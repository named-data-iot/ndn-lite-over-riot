NDN-Lite Over RIOT OS
========================

Work In Progress

* You need to fetch [ndn-lite](https://github.com/named-data-iot/ndn-lite)  `new-riot` branch  as  outside package.
* RIOT version is not the official repo nor the `named-data-iot` but a one under a personal account [RIOT](https://github.com/Zhiyi-Zhang/RIOT).
